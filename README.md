Mathjobs Helper

One of the major challenges that every person would face in his/her life is to find and apply for a decent job. No matter what type of jobs or higher education one is searching, i.e., post-docs, industry or even a PhD, the process could be exhausting and painful. In most of the time, like when applying for PhD, one needs to search from website to website of different institution for materials requirement, deadlines, etc. On the other hand, when applying for post-docs and industrial jobs, even though there are websites like mathjobs.org and linkedin.com where jobs are aggregated by their search engines, the detailed information from job to job are in different format, sometimes one still needs to do a lot of clicking and searching to find the information he/she needs and generate a job listing xls/csv file for own convenience. With web scraping technique, this process can be greatly simplified and save a lot of time in PhD or job applications.

In this project, I will show how the information from mathjobs.org (post-doc positions for math and stat majors) could be scraped from web and munged properly to generate a clean, detailed csv file. All deadlines, job locations and research areas are caught in one table and no more clicking and searching is needed. The project is carried out in Python with packages "pandas" and "requests". The same idea could be easily extended to other job boards or PhD applications.
